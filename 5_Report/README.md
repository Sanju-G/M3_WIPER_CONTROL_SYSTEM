A Windscreen or windshield wiper is a device used to remove rain and debris from a windscreen or windshield. Almost all motor vehicles motor, including trains, 
aircraft and watercraft, are equipped with such wipers, which are usually a legal requirement.
The first windshield wipers were brushes. Inventor J. H. Apjohn came up with a method of moving two brushes reciprocate on a vertical plate glass windshield
in 1903. In the same year, Mary Anderson devised a swinging arm that swept rain off the windshield when the driver moved a lever located inside the car.

I would like to point out that, despite the fact that practically everything about this design has previously been defined, there are still several 
types of enhancements that may be implemented to make it even more convenient. In terms of efficiency and cost effectiveness, the project that we have 
developed and presented is pretty effective. In comparison to the optical sensor, it has significant advantages in that it can accommodate all of the 
design parameters as well as the needs of the average person. This project can benefit from the addition of a speed-controlling mechanism, which will 
allow it to operate in accordance with the intensity and speed of the water flowing through the sensor. The fundamental manoeuvring is done merely to
make it more cost-effective and reliable in the long run. The idea i have been implemented is completly in working condition these can be used in any 
type of cars.We can also make this wiper system automatic by adding sensors for rain water falling on the wind shiled,dust resistance sensor,etc.
So,there is no need to control the wiper system manually while driving the car.It can be more convinient we add the additional features to the wiper 
system and it can be done in near future.
People around the world still working on this project so that we can make a system that works requires less human intervention.
