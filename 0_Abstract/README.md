# Abstract
This is an era of automation where it is broadly 
defined as replacement of manual effort by mechanical power 
in all degrees of automation. Now a dayâ€™s almost all the 
automobile vehicles are being atomized in order to reduce 
human efforts. The AUTOMATIC RAIN OPERATED WIPER 
system is a fully automation project. This is a genuine project 
which is designed for automobile vehicles and is fully equipped 
by sensor circuit and wiper motor. This project work includes 
design and development of a control system based on 
electronically controlled automotive rain operated motor called 
AUTOMATIC RAIN OPERATED WIPER.

A Windscreen or windshield wiper is a device used to 
remove rain and debris from a windscreen or windshield. 
Almost all motor vehicles motor, including trains, aircraft 
and watercraft, are equipped with such wipers, which are 
usually a legal requirement. The first windshield wipers 
were brushes. Inventor J. H. Apjohn came up with a method 
of moving two brushes reciprocate on a vertical plate glass 
windshield in 1903. In the same year, Mary Anderson 
devised a swinging arm that swept rain off the windshield 
when the driver moved a lever located inside the car. 
Anderson patented her invention of the mechanical 
windshield wiper in 1905, and it became standard equipment 
by 1913. Electric motors were not used yet to power 
automobile essentials or accessories. Without another power 
source, a driver had to use one hand to move the lever. 
Rubber strips replaced brushes as the cleaning tools on 
wipers in 1905. Unfortunately, the hazardous need for 
drivers to wipe windshields while driving was not 
eliminated until 1917. The solution was to use an electric 
motor to move a single wiper with a long rubber blade back 
and forth. Hawaiian dentist Dr. Ormand Wall invented the 
automatic wiper by placing an electric motor in the top 
center of the windshield so the wiper arced down over the 
hood of the car in a semi-circular or rainbow shape. Wipers 
were one of the first electrical devices in automobiles after 
the electric starter was developed in 1912. Most wipers on 
cars before 1930 were paired and hung down from the top of 
the windshield. They were moved to the base of the 
windshield as electrical systems became more complicated. 
In 1989 Hideki Kajioka, etal. [1] in their paper an automatic 
wiper which detects rain drops with an optical rain sensor 
was developed. This automatic wiper is implemented by 
combining an existing wiper system with a sensor and 
controller.
